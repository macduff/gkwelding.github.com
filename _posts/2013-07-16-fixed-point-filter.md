We can use [this here link](http://lorien.ncl.ac.uk/ming/filter/fillpass.htm) as a
starting point.  This is a **classic** single pole lowpass filter.  I would hazard
a guess that this is the most popular linear filter found in control applications.
Sure, there are all other kinds of filters, each with its pros and cons, but this
filter is very intuitive.  First order is often how we want and expect systems to
respond.
